# Physics-Informed-AI-for-Cosmic-Event-Classification

Area: AI, Big Data, Machine Learning, Distributed Computing
Problem:The PLAsTiCC dataset contains vast amounts of time-series data from astronomical
observations, which is challenging to process and classify due to its scale and complexity.
Tech: PySpark, Spark SQL, Spark DataFrames, HDF5
Results: Achieved higher classification accuracy on rare astronomical events by embedding physical
constraints into the model. PySpark enabled scalable training on large datasets, making the approach
practical for real-time cosmic event analysis.
